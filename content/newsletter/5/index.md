Hi :slightly_smiling_face:,<br>
let's get straight into the…

## Review of the last challenge

Last week's challenge was: [No audio-visual media](newsletter/4#next-challenge)

The challenge went well and I feel much better because of it.
I will keep it up indefinitely, making exceptions where I'm positively
drawn to something, e.g. an on-topic audiobook during a long drive, Tolle
to become more present, a new chapter of a manga when I feel like it.

Some new and re-enforced learnings:
- On the first day, I didn't start the challenge in earnest, eventhough I
had already decided that I would do it, because I hadn't sent out the
newsletter annoucing it yet.
  Without the commitment I lacked resolve.
- Boredom quickly overcame me.
  I soon found other things to do: stuff that came up urgently, tasks that I
  had been postponing, ideas that just popped into my head.
  I like the boredom much better than the automatic busyness of being so
  drawn to consume.
- I got more intrinsic motivation to write and more satisfaction from the
  process.
  I didn't feel constantly pulled toward some easier way to get a dopamine
  kick.
- Consuming media is not relaxing.
  If what I need is a break, media consumption is not a suitable
alternative.
  It's stressful for the brain, giving it a lot to process.
  This quote describes it beautifully:
  > This new technology paralyzed us into atonia — we became an awake brain
locked in a motionless body [..][^src]
- I had three instances of long (5h+) media binges.
  One reading the complete run of a manga and the other two on reddit.
  These interfered with my sleep and I felt like I couldn't stop.
  Not great.
  Reddit is getting banned (that scrolling is pointless.)
  For the manga, complete abstinence doesn't seem like the way.
  I don't have all of the answers (yet) for the best approach to handling
  this whole topic of media consumption.
  More experimentation will be necessary.

## Next challenge

This week I'll do some sun salutations (a simple yoga sequence) as the first
thing after getting out of bed.
This will help structure my morning.
And I wanted to introduce more stretching/exercise to my life anyway, with
this being an easy start since I already know the sequence by heart.
