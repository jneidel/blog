Hi, this is the first edition of my weekly newsletter.
I'm sure the format will evolve over time.

## Last challenge

Last weeks challenge was, for a second time, to apply the Hemingway trick.
Here the quick version of it:

> The best way is always to stop when you are going good and when you know
what will happen next. If you do that every day when you are writing a
novel, you will never be stuck â€“ Ernest Hemingway

I have already put down some more detailed thoughts that I will turn into an
essay.
Just to say this: it works and it's not as easy if you are not writing a
novel but are working on many different things.

## Next challenge

From the upcoming Saturday on I'll be attending a week-long NLP Practitioner
seminar.
I have been preparing by studying the provided theory.

For next weeks challenge I want to learn the different hypnotic language
patterns of the Milton model and apply them to my self-talk.

Then on Sat and Sun, the start of the seminar, I want to focus on
remembering peoples names.
If somebody introduces themselves, I want to be able to remember their name.
I've struggled with that in the past (I know it's hard for everyone), but I
want to make an effort.

## New articles

I produced two german articles this week, which cover somewhat
Germany-specific topics. I doubt I will translate them.
