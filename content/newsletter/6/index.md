Hi :slightly_smiling_face:,<br>
I had been wandering aimlessly, without a clear goal for some time now.
This week I finally sat down to figure out what I want to focus on next.
What my next big project would be.
I wrote [project post](/de/project/börsenstrategie/){{<de>}} about it.

## Review of the last challenge

Last week's challenge was: [Doing some sun salutations after waking up](newsletter/5#next-challenge)

I did them every morning.
Not always right after waking up, but after getting out of bed.
I put my clothes on my yoga mat, so I wouldn't forget (it's called habit
stacking[^habit-stack].)
My body was very stiff when I started, on those day where I did the exercise
right after waking up and noticably warmed up afterwards.
Over the week I even saw some progression in my ability to stretch, but this
was most likely just a return to a previous form.
I did 10.5 mins of stretching on average (post on how I track my time is to
follow.)
I will keep this up, as I want to add more exercise to my life anyway.

[^habit-stack]: By doing a new habit right after or before an existing one,
you can hook onto the working habit.
It makes it much easier to adopt something new.
Reference: <cite>Atomic Habits</cite>.

## Next challenge

For next week, I want to prime myself and increase the focus on my the goal
I created for myself.
The technique I will use is: **4x4 + Visualizations**

- 4x4 means writing down four times my four greatest goals (of this or the next years,
or any subgoals).
- For visualizations I'll start with this script:

Take one of the 4x4 goals.
Close your eyes.
Relax and get myself into trance.
Breath deeply 10 times.
Float into the situation, in which you have accomplished your goal.
Really go into the situation and turn up the submodalities (an NLP
technique.)
All while listening to the approriate [Neurostream](review/neurostreams)
(Die Zukunft schauen.)

I have a few more optimizations to play around with, but this will be plenty
to start.
I will try before and after breakfast.
Before is probably better.
