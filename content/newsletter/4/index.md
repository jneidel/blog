Hi :slightly_smiling_face:,<br>
my YouTube 'addiction' kicked in hard again.
(It's more than just YouTube.)
It ate up a lot of time and drew my focus away from what was important.

Unlike the last time this happened, I didn't dig myself into a deep hole.
I got my job done on time, held up most established practices, kept up
relationships and did some reading and productive work.
Being so drawn to consuming media takes up a lot of my focus and time.
So naturally, I have to get rid of this habit again.

## Next challenge

And the way I got rid of that 'addiction' successfully in the past was
through this **No audio-visual media** challenge.
It's my spin on the "dopamine detox" concept.

Like the name says, it prohibits me from consuming media that falls under
the audio-visual umbrella.
Purely audio counts all the same.

Especially (but not limited to):
- No YouTube
- No documentaries
- No comedy specials
- No audiobooks
- No podcasts, including educational
- No manga
- No porn
- No movies, series (weren't allowed before either)

Explicitly allowed are only music and any course material I'm actively
studying (e.g. a language course.)

This procedure will stop me from passively consuming and make me bored
again.
And boredom, in turn, sparks my interest for projects, reading, writing,
chores, etc.

I will run this for at least two weeks (starting Sep10.)

## Review of the last challenge

The last challenge was: [Wearing formal clothes for improved performance](newsletter/3#next-challenge)

When I put on my formal clothes, it felt helpful.
I was focused and did my work.
Adverse behaviors only happened when I didn't have them on.
The caveat: I didn't put them on a lot.

Putting on the clothes acted like a commitment.
I knew that, if I put them on, I would commit myself to focus on the
task at hand, and I did.
But nothing happened when I didn't put them on.
When I didn't want to commit.
These clothes can enhance my focus, but only if I am willing to commit to it.
They are useful.
But it's not exactly what I need right now.
I will keep this in mind for future application, though.

## New articles

- I wrote down some thoughts on a [documentary](review/20-days-in-mariupol)
showing Russiaâ€™s 2022 invasion of Ukraine from a civilian perspective.

As usual: I got more in the pipeline that didn't get finished in time
:smile:.

Cheers,<br>
Jonathan
