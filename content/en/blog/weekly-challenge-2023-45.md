**Week 45 of 2023**

## Accessing my productivity system

> Every system is perfect for the result it is getting.[^s]

I'm not satisfied with the results my productivity system is delivering.
The results that it create are good.
But there is a lot of time wasted working on unimportant things, getting
distracted, not working at all.
All of which frustrate me.

My approach in the past was usually to add to the system.
Processes. Scripts. Habits. Rules.

After coming across Occam's Razor[^occam_razor],
I wanted to approach this restructuring by getting rid of the harmful while
keeping the good parts.

First I wanted to gain a detached understanding of the current system.
To this end I just wrote down what a normal day looks like, all the different
ways I get derailed from work.
Next: analyzing patterns and coming up with ideas:
- What are the bad habits that derail the whole day?
- At what point is the flow split into a bunch of possibilities?
- How can this decision node be streamlined or avoided?
- How do you break up your work?[^bw]
- What work blocks are the most productive?
- What interferes with you making full use of them? Or circumvents them
completely?
- How can they be defended from interruptions?

The most productive time slot for me is the early morning.
To protect it from being derailed and to eliminate a bunch of diverging paths I
made a slight adjustment as described [here](/blog/weekly-challenge-2023-44/).

I now concisely wrote down the habits I identified within my existing system.
Seeing them so clearly in front of me I could chain the individual habits
together. Clarifying the steps that I'm supposed to take for each habit and
the transitions between them helped me reduce my sky-high abandonment rate[^1].

[^1]: Abandoning my routine half-way was so bad that I basically never did my
    full morning routine.
[^bw]: E.g.: 6am until the daily standup; from the first meeting block until lunch;
    between lunch and 18:00; between dinner and 1am
