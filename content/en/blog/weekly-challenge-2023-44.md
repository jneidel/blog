**Week 44 of 2023**

## No complaints[^nocomplaints]

There was a lot of switching the bracelet this week.

I actually thought I was a pretty positive person[^1].
This challenge showed me that there actually is a lot of room for improvement.
The challenge actually made me conscious of these little negative behaviors that
always went by unnoticed.
Without this self-awareness there can be no change.

From "victimless" crimes like complaining about some terrible drivers and Berlin
traffic in general, to getting mad at Heroku for some unexpected behavior or
talking shit about our neighbours and an obese woman at the pool.

These are "only" creating a negative mood.
More harmful I found the instance were I was enumerating the shortcomings of a
colleague.
How is this gonna effect my work in that team? Negatively.

If I only look at how they don't live up to my standards, I'm gonna miss the
thing that they can bring to the table. And everybody has something.
Focusing on others others strengths instead of their shortcomings is gonna make
me a better leader, team player, brother, friend and husband.
Especially when the person in question is very different from me or has very
different priorities.

Another not great thing I caught myself with was discouraging my wife.
Shes very uninhibited and playful and was customizing her pizza
(by putting a whole, uncut ball of mozzarella on there) and instead of letting
her enjoy it I have to comment on how this is going to go wrong.
And even if I'm right (and I was), I still made it less fun for her, for no good
reason.

how averages work. You are most likely average or very close to average in a lot
of things.
