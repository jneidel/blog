*Each trip must have a singular reason for why you're taking it.*

## Background

I used to live in the big city. I wanted more peace and quiet so I moved out
into the countryside. But I still had work[^1], friends and family in the city.

Naturally I took regular trips[^2] to the city. And while we're
there we might as well get some parts from my old bike store, a new backpack,
and groceries from specialty stores (Asia, Turkish, Viatnamese).

[^1]: mostly remote, but they want to see my face around the office from time to time
[^2]: 2h one way
