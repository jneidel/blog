    people that week and I want to challenge myself to consciously interact with
    them in a more positive manner
- [ ] Week 24: No interrupting others. I've done this before and it was great. I
    will be meeting some friends that week.
- [ ] Week 25: No new information. Only read and listen to what I have read or
    listened to before.
<!-- - [ ] Week <++>: <++> -->

<!-- - [ ] Week 24: Writing and publishing two shorter blog articles per day or one long one -->
<!-- - [ ] Week 22: Write down 4x4 goals (4 biggest goals, 4 times each) followed by -->
<!--     a visualization technique that sounds actually effective -->
<!--     (not just a loose "just imagine it bro") -->
<!-- - [ ] Week 22: Ask myself multiple times through-out the day -->
<!--     "Does this feel right for me? Does this feel right for the other person?" -->

If you have a suggestion for something I should try,

## What is this?

Above you find the list of challenges that I have done/will be doing.
My goal is to write an article about the experience of each challenge.
So for past challenges you will find those articles linked.
Each challenge also comes with a short description of what it's about/what my
intention for it was.

## Benefits of keeping a page like this

Defining challenges ahead of time stops this behavior in it's track:
"Oh, I don't know what challenge to do next", which leads to "Damn I forgot to
define a challenge" :right_arrow: "I guess I'll skip this week" :right_arrow:
_\*ignores next reminder\*_.

It also works as a way to keep me accountable to stick with these challenges.
I combine it with an accountability group that I keep up with every week.

This page will be updated continuously and it will grow with time.
