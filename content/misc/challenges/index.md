Current streak: 1 week
{{</badge>}}

- [x] Week 19: "[The power plant doesn't have power, it generates power](essay/power-plant)"
    â€“ become aware of when I feel like I don't have the energy to do something and
    then generate that power
- [ ] Week 20: Eat that frog. Start every day by working on the hardest task. I
    used to do this, but it has slipped away. Now I work on whatever comes to mind.
- [ ] Week 21: Ask myself multiple times through-out the day
    "Does this feel right for me? Does this feel right for the other person?"
- [ ] Week 22: Write down 4x4 goals (4 biggest goals, 4 times each) followed by
    a visualization technique that sounds actually effective
    (not just a loose "just imagine it bro")
- [ ] Week 23: "People are like balloons, with each interaction you can either
    let some air out of them, or blow them up a little." - I will be around
    people that week and I want to challenge myself consciously interact with
    them in a more positive manner
- [ ] Week 24: Writing and publishing two shorter blog articles per day or one long one
<!-- - [ ] Week <++>: <++> -->

If you have a suggestion for something I should try,
just [let me know](mailto:challenge-suggestion@jneidel.com) :slightly_smiling_face:.

## What is this?

Above you find the list of challenges that I have done/will be doing.
My goal is to write an article about the experience of each challenge.
So for past challenges you will find those articles linked.
Each challenge also comes with a short description of what it's about/what my
intention for it was.

## Benefits of keeping a page like this

Defining challenges ahead of time stops this behavior in it's track:
"Oh, I don't know what challenge to do next", which leads to "Damn I forgot to
define a challenge" :right_arrow: "I guess I'll skip this week" :right_arrow:
_\*ignores next reminder\*_.

It also works as a way to keep me accountable to stick with these challenges.
I combine it with an accountability group that I keep up with every week.

This page will be updated continuously and it will grow with time.
