## What are open ear headphones?

As the name suggests: your ears are not covered by putting something over
them (over-ear) or into them (in-ear).
The result is: you can clearly hear the outside world at all times.

## Why Oladance?

In late 2022, when I was looking for a pair of open ear headphones,
the selection was very small.
I got one of the available styles each and tried them out:

I felt right at home with the [Oladance][first generation].
My wife preferred the [bone-conduction headphones] and kept them :smile:

## Why open ear?

Open ear headphones have some advantages over in-ear and over-ear
headphones:

- You can hear what's going on around you. Can be convenient, pleasant or a
safety feature[^safety] (depending on use.)
- You can hear your own voice, which is not being blocked out.
- Comfort. They are more comfortable over an extended period of time
(nothing in or pressing on your ear.)
- Stable. They will not fall off your head (no problem on the trampoline.)

[^safety]: Open ear headphones are often advertised as safe, because you can
    hear traffic around you while you are jogging for example.
    It's not listed in my use cases, because I don't have traffic where I
    live.

### Downsides

I've only found one downside:
You can hear what's going on around you!
That can be distracting!

They're not great on public transport or around construction, crowds of
people, big roads, etc.
But I'm not in those environments much anymore (if I am I'll use my noise
canceling over-ear headphones.)

## My experience

Open ear headphones shine in quiet environments!

How I make use of them is best described in use cases:

**Use case 1: person talks to you**

I'm in the kitchen and listening to something.
My wife can just walk up and start talking to me.
There is not this moment of stopping the audio, taking your headphones off
and asking "Huh? What did you say?" and the other person repeating
themselves.

Because of the open ear design I understood her the first time.
I still might turn off what I was listening to, but I don't need to (unless
it's very loud.)

**Use case 2: listen to something in the background**

I'm at home, working or doing something.
There are a few different things I might listen to on low volume, passively
in the background.
That might be a [Neurostream](review/neurostreams), silent subliminal, my
philosophy or a language learning piece on a loop.
Either way, I can have it conveniently running in the background, while
hearing everything else normally.

**Use case 3: hearing nature**

I live at the edge of a forest, which I visit regularly.
With my open ear headphones, I can listen to audiobooks and have calls,
while still hearing the calming and satisfying sounds of nature:
the birds chirping, my footsteps through the high grass, branches breaking
under my feet, the wind blowing past me, etc.
It would be the same without the soundscape.

**Use case 4: for language learning**

To train your speaking ability you will want to: hear a word and then say
that word.
You need the practice to get your pronunciation right.

Open ear headphones allow me to hear my own voice naturally.
I can have my headphones on and listen to an audio course or my
vocabulary on the go, repeat what I heard and while hearing my own voice
unimpaired.

### Sound quality

Sound quality is good and music will be enjoyable if you don't have any
overwhelming environment noise.
Calls are enjoyable for both sides :slightly_smiling_face:

## Price

I paid 120â‚¬ back in 2022 and that is still the price today.
For me it was well worth what I paid.

### What model to get today?

Nowadays there are many more models to choose from.
After the [first generation], Oladance released a [second generation] and
a [pro version].
[JBL] and [soundcore] also created some more affordable alternatives.

I haven't looked at what's available today in detail, but I would probably
go with Oladance again, if mine were to break now.

## Conclusions

I'm really happy with my Oladance.
They are the pair I use the most out of all my headphones and speakers.
They nicely address the described use cases and present a uniquely
comfortable and convenient solution.
