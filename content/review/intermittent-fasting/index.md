## What is it?

Restrict your eating to a certain time window.
The notation for describing eating and fasting times is this: 16-8.
Which means: 16 hours of fasting and 8 hours of eating.

## Why?

Digestion is an energy intense process for your body.
If you give your body a window of fasting, it is able to actually finishing the
digestion process and trigger repair mechanisms.

Only after 10-12h of fasting will your body start to repurpose aged cells and
reduce inflammation. This positively impacts the immune system.

## My experience

At the point where I adopted intermittent fasting I was already eating right.
I was not spiking my bloodsugar and my meals kept me sated for a long time.

My last meal was already at most 2:30h before my bedtime, as to not effect sleep
quality.
I was basically already doing an intermitted fasting schedule of 12-12.
I decided to try 14-10, by just moving up the last meal by 2h.
It was easy and I just stuck with it.
16-8 happened automatically.
I eat my first meal within an hour of waking up and the second and last meal
around lunch.

I did not notice much of a difference (wasn't paying so much attention either),
but even if there is not a perceivable difference I know that I'm doing my body
some good at no cost in convenience.

I don't set an alarm or anything.
I know at what time I am supposed to stop eating (it's the same every day) and
my body knows it too.

I do break the intermittent fasting rule occasionally and feel worse for it, but
I can't soley attribute that to IF, since it usually coincides with other rule
breaks such as sugar, eating 2.5h before bed, not eating in a way that does not
spike my bloodsugar, etc.

## Conclusion

Intermittent fasting is very easy to do if you fix your diet before.
You set it up once and then don't think about it much.
Benefits for me only exist on paper, but that's fine, since it's such an easy fix.
