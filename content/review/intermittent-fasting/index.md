## What is intermittent fasting?

Restrict your eating to a certain time window.
The notation for describing eating and fasting times is this: 16-8.
Which means: 16 hours of fasting and 8 hours of eating.

## Why do it?

Digestion is an energy intense process for your body.
If you give your body a window of fasting, it is able to actually finishing the
digestion process and trigger repair mechanisms.

Only after 10-12h of fasting will your body start to repurpose aged cells and
reduce inflammation. This positively impacts the immune system.

## How I applied it in my life

When I first heard of intermittent fasting and especial 16-8, it sounded
crazy to me.
How is that gonna work? I'm just gonna be hungry. Why would I do that to
myself?
I tried it a bit and it was a lot of effort and not worth it at all.

Time passed.
I worked on my diet and found something that fills me and gives me energy
for a long time.
And then I stumbled over intermittent fasting again.

I was already not eating 2:30h before going to bed (as this negatively
impacts sleep quality, digestions diverts energy away from recovery.)
I counted the hours and as it turns out, I was basically already doing an
intermittent fasting schedule of 12-12.

So, I decided to just try 14-10, (it's just a small change after all), by
eating the last meal 2h earlier.
During the day I never felt hungry.
Only in the morning, but that was already the case before :smile:

At this point I was only eating breakfast and lunch.
It felt natural to just eat breakfast earlier.
So, 16-8 happened automatically.

| Eating schedule | Eating window example |
|:-:|:-:|
| 12-12 | 6:00 - 18:00 |
| 14-10 | 6:00 - 16:00 |
| 16-8  | 6:00 - 14:00 |

## Skip breakfast or dinner?

> Breakfast is the most important meal of the day.
> <br>â€“ A cereal commercial

The industry is trying to sell you something with that quote, but there is
some truth to it.

In the morning your body is the most efficient at processing
food[^insulinmorgens].
Eating soon after waking also signals to your inner clock that the day is
starting.
<!-- [^losgeht]. -->

[^insulinmorgens]: In the morning your body is best at producing Insulin.
    Insulin stimulates the processing and absorption of (blood) sugar.
    This means, that your body can more easily convert food into energy and
    instead of storing it as fat.
[^losgeht]: [Source](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/nbu.12323)

Both eating savory in the morning and eating soon after waking up (ideal is
the slot 30 mins to 1.5h after waking) took some getting used to.
But, I do feel better with this schedule than without it.

## What about the benefits?

For me and the way I have integrated intermittent fasting in my life, there
a few to no costs.
The only one that comes to mind, is not being able to eat dinner.
But, I do make exceptions for some dinner (happens rarely.)
That means, that any upside, any positive effect that intermittent fasting
has on me, I basically get for free.

For me, there is not much of an effect that I have observed.
I have always had a good immune system and no problems with inflammation.
Just knowing that it's good for my body is enough for me.

Most of the benefits that people report after starting intermittent fasting
I would attribute to be the result of eating better.
Because you can't do <abbr title="intermittent fasting">IF</abbr> and eat
like crap.
That is gonna be torture.
And for a lot of people, who try <abbr title="intermittent fasting">IF</abbr>,
it is torture.

## Alarms & Tracking

As you can imagine I don't need to set alarms or anything.
My body is hungry in the morning and then knows when it's time for lunch.
Easy.

I do have <abbr title="intermittent fasting">IF</abbr> in my habit tracker,
just so I don't forget about it.
Because actions that are easy and automated can easily slip my mind with the
passage of time.

## Exceptions to the schedule

I do break the intermittent fasting rule occasionally.
- There was no earlier opportunity for me to eat.
- There is a dinner, which doubles as a social occasion, that I want to
participate attend.

The results is always the same: I feel worse.
But, I can't solely attribute that to breaking my intermittent fasting rule,
because it usually coincides with other rule breaks, such as: eating sugar,
eating less than 2.5h before bed or eating in a way that spikes my blood
sugar.

I am aware of these costs and if the dinner is important to me, I will bear
them.

## Conclusion

Intermittent fasting is very easy to do, if your diet already gives you
energy for at least 6-8h.
And that's a big if.

Intermittent fasting itself you set up once and then don't think about it
much.
Benefits for me only exist on paper, but that's fine, since it's such an
easy fix.
