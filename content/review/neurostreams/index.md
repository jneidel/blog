## What are Neurostreams?

[Neurostreams](https://www.neurostreams.de#aff=jneidel) are a powerful tool for putting you into a desired state.
The product itself is a collection of sounds.

These sounds can make you more focused, calm you down, put you into
deep meditation, give you energy and motivation and more.

If you want to get an idea of what they sound like:
<audio controls src="https://server10077.streamplus.de/"></audio>

A caveat up-front: There is not an official English version of this product.
For the sounds that does **not** make a difference.
For your convenience I wrote an English [quick reference guide](misc/neurostreams-quick-reference)
that works as an overview for all the available tracks.
It also links to the translated catalogue pages where you can find more
details about each sound.
**With that, you should have everything you need, to get the most out of this
great tool.**

## How does it work?

Your brainwaves oscillate around a given frequency.
Each frequency is associated with a certain state.
Frequencies are commonly grouped into[^freq]:

- Delta: Deep sleep
- Theta: Light sleep, meditation
- Alpha: Relaxed wakefulness, idle, unfocused
- Beta: Active concentration, analytical thinking, problem-solving
- Gamma: Use of higher cognitive functions, highly motivated, peak performance

[^freq]: [Read more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_oscillation)

When listening to a Neurostream, your brainwaves synchronize with the
frequency of the included beat.
The beat then modifies that frequency (and your brainwaves along with it) to
take you to a wave length associated with the desired state.

## Applications

There are a bunch of different tracks, all tailored to specific
applications.
I prefer Neurostreams over random YouTube videos, which promise
similar effects.
These Neurostreams were carefully built, tested and refined.
They were designed with specific applications in mind and come with clear usage instructions.
You don't need to figure them out for myself, you get a working toolbox.

In these sections I will only discus my personal favorites.
There are plenty more out there.
The purpose of this review is to give you an idea of what is possible and
what Neurostreams are doing for me.
You can find a concise overview of all available tracks in my
[quick reference guide](misc/neurostreams-quick-reference).

### To calm you down

Sometimes you just need to take a break.
Why not go into a deep regeneration, so you can come back afterwards with
full force?

I've always taken a little siesta.
But whatever I did, I never felt truly relaxed after.
Mediation takes a lot of practice to get good at.
Napping is ineffective, since I can't fall asleep.
It was always better than nothing, but not what I had hoped for.

Neurostreams dramatically increased the effectiveness of my siesta.
They get me into deep meditation without effort or consistently put me into
a near sleep state much deeper than a nap.

<!-- TODO: remove duplication -->

If at any time during the day I am anxious, my thoughts are racing or I am
stressed and have fast and shallow breathing, then I will just do one of
these sessions and calm right down.

I have put calming down as the first category for a reason.
Having the ability to calm down a frantic mind or recharging my batteries in
the middle of the day is just invaluable.

It just works. Reliably. A tool I never want to miss.

#### The tracks

{{<button href="/documents/neurostreams/katalog-en/DNA_Talk.pdf" target="_blank">}}
DNA Talk :person_in_lotus_position:
{{</button>}}

The standard meditation track.

In the past (after a lot of training) I was able to meditate deeply for a
good amount of time.
But now, after losing that routine, it is hard to just sit down for 5 mins.
This track makes it easy though.
It mediates you.
You just sit there.
30 mins of meditation are easily doable.

Skip the practice and get right to the results.

{{<button href="/documents/neurostreams/katalog-en/Gaia_Club_Radio.pdf" target="_blank">}}
Gaia Club Radio :radio:
{{</button>}}

My new favorite.
It's deeper than DNA Talk and I don't think of it as meditation.
I just lie down and deeply relax.
Afterwards I'm more aware, refreshed and ready to tackle a new task.

### To improve your work

We require focus for a lot of our work. Studying, writing,
researching, reading or any kind of knowledge work.

These Neurostreams are an easy thing to add.
They will increase not only your output, but also the satisfaction you
derive from it by reliably getting you into flow.
They will train your ability to concentrate.
Making it easier to focus in _all_ situations.

I've had tremendous success with these, especially in combination with a
media diet that excluded anything that might lower my attention span.

#### The tracks

{{<button href="/documents/neurostreams/katalog-en/Flow_meets_genius-Flow_triff_Genie.pdf" target="_blank">}}
Flow meets genius :handshake: Flow triff Genie
{{</button>}}

<!-- TODO: boring -->

My all-round favorite Neurostream.
It will get you into flow and focus-mode, but can also be used in general
for lifting your mood and decreasing anxiety and stress.

{{<button href="/documents/neurostreams/katalog-en/IQ_7000.pdf" target="_blank">}}
IQ 7000 :brain:
{{</button>}}

My main focus track, because it gets me to to focus a little deeper.
I will switch this one up with Flow meets genius, since I don't want to wear
headphones all day.

{{<button href="/documents/neurostreams/katalog-en/Brainstorms.pdf" target="_blank">}}
Brainstorms :lightning:
{{</button>}}

As the name suggests: for more effective brainstorming sessions.
The beat is unpredictable and will trigger your brain to make new
connection.
Worked really well when I used it.

### To energize yourself

Sometimes you are unmotivated and can't get going.
But, you want or need to perform.

That's where these Neurostreams come it.
They will speed up your brainwaves to a level where **you will want to do
whatever you set out for yourself.**

Great for [generating energy](essay/power-plant).

#### The tracks

{{<button href="/documents/neurostreams/katalog-en/Sturm_und_Drang.pdf" target="_blank">}}
Sturm und Drang :thunder_cloud_and_rain:
{{</button>}}

For an acute case of demotivation.
Gets you up and going.

For whenever you need or want to perform.
Very helpful for getting yourself into shape for work, when you're not
really feeling it.

### To fall asleep

Sometimes you just can't fall asleep.
For whatever reason.

Not being able to sleep is hurting your recovery and hurts your performance
the day after.

This is the most effective way I've found to addressing that problem.
All other solutions (writing down your thoughts, sleep drink, get up and
doing something else and then returning, etc.) are just hacks in comparison.

#### The tracks

{{<button href="/documents/neurostreams/katalog-en/Sleep_forcing-Schlaferzwingung.pdf" target="_blank">}}
Sleep forcing :sleeping: Schlaferzwingung
{{</button>}}

Personally I have a hard time falling asleep.
My wife can sleep anywhere and any time.
She falls asleep so quickly, it's astonishing.
But, that's not me.

When I'm excited about something.
When my thoughts are racing.
When I had a little too much bluelight or activity before going to bed.
I just sometimes have a hard time falling sleep.
I try it naturally, but at some point I need a hammer to knock myself out
and force it.

This Neurostream is that tool.
You just force yourself to fall asleep.

## Costs

I started with the [Panorama](https://www.neurostreams.de/portfolio/panorama/#aff=jneidel),
which is a diverse set of tracks covering the whole range of what
Neurostreams can do for you.
At only 9€ getting that was a no-brainer for me.
I recommend you start with that as well.

The Panorama itself will already get you quite far.
If you want some of the missing track or some variety (other versions)
of the Panorama tracks, then you can think about an upgrade.

**Don't think about upgrading until you have intensely tested the Panorama.**

Here are all the [upgrade options](https://www.neurostreams.de/produkte/#aff=jneidel).
I went for the Kompendium bundle, which provides all the classics I talked about
in this post.
For me it was ca. 100€, because I bought it through the Grand Slam.
The laboratory (Labor) includes more niche, experimental tracks, which
weren't of interest to me.

**Try it for free**

- On the [homepage](https://www.neurostreams.de#aff=jneidel) Tim has a radio station that cycles through some tracks.
- [Signing up for the newsletter](https://www.neurostreams.de#aff=jneidel) gets you the title <a href="/documents/neurostreams/katalog-en/Planet_Relax.pdf" target="_blank">Planet Relax</a>.

## Conclusions

A great tool I don't want to live without.
