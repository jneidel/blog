## What are Neurostreams?

[Neurostreams](https://www.neurostreams.de#aff=jneidel) are a powerful tool for putting you into a desired state.
The product itself is a collection of sounds.

These sounds can make you more focused, calm you down, put you into
deep meditation, give you energy and motivation and more.

If you want to get an idea of what they sound like:
<audio controls src="https://server10077.streamplus.de/"></audio>

A caveat up-front: There is not an official English version of this product.
For the sounds that does **not** make a difference.
For your convenience I wrote an English [quick reference guide](misc/neurostreams-quick-reference)
that works as an overview for all the available tracks.
It also links to the translated catalogue pages where you can find more
details about each sound.
**With that, you should have everything you need, to get the most out of this
great tool.**

## How does it work?

Your brainwaves oscillate around a given frequency.
Each frequency is associated with a certain state.
Frequencies are commonly grouped into[^freq]:

- Delta: Deep sleep
- Theta: Light sleep, meditation
- Alpha: Relaxed wakefulness, idle, unfocused
- Beta: Active concentration, analytical thinking, problem-solving
- Gamma: Use of higher cognitive functions, highly motivated, peak performance

[^freq]: [Read more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_oscillation)

When listening to a Neurostream, your brainwaves synchronize with the
frequency of the included beat.
The beat then modifies that frequency (and your brainwaves along with it) to
take you to a wave length associated with the desired state.

## Why this product?

I prefer Neurostreams over random YouTube videos, which promise
similar effects.
These tracks were carefully built, tested and refined.
They were designed with specific applications in mind and come with clear
usage instructions.
You don't need to figure them out for myself, you get a working toolbox.

Frankly, I discovered this kind of brainwave manipulation through
Neurostreams and never bothered to venture outside of them, since I was very
happy with what I got.

## Applications

Neurostreams exist for various different applications, to which they are
specifically tailored.
I will introduce them in groups based what you can achieve with them.
I will only be discussing my personal favorites.
Just know that there are plenty more out there.
You can discover what works best for your personal use-cases.

The purpose of this review is to give you an idea of what is possible and
what Neurostreams are doing for me.
Those that are interested in more options & details can find a
concise overview of all available tracks in my [quick reference guide](misc/neurostreams-quick-reference).

### Calm me down

Sometimes you just need to take a break.
With these tracks you can put yourself into a near sleep state, from which
you are woken up again.
You can deeply regenerate for a time and effectively recover, ready to
tackle the next thing afterwards.

#### How I use it

I had always taken a little siesta (lying down some time after lunch.)
But whatever I did, I never felt truly relaxed after.
Mediation takes a lot of practice to get good at.
Napping was ineffective for me, since I can't fall asleep.
It was always better than nothing, but not what I had hoped for.

Neurostreams dramatically increased the effectiveness of my siesta.
They get me into deep meditation without effort or consistently put me into
a near sleep state much deeper than my nap ever were.
And with less effort.
Much less.

It also gave me a tool to calm myself in urgent cases of anxiety, where my
thoughts are racing or I was stressed.
I can just do one of these session to be more at ease.

It just works. Reliably. A tool I never want to miss.

#### The tracks

{{<button href="/documents/neurostreams/katalog-en/DNA_Talk.pdf" target="_blank">}}
DNA Talk :person_in_lotus_position:
{{</button>}}

The standard meditation track.

In the past (after a lot of training) I was able to meditate deeply for a
good amount of time.
But now, after losing that routine, it is hard to just sit down for 5 mins.
This track makes it easy though.
It meditates you.
You just sit there.
30 mins of meditation are easily doable.

Skip the practice and get right to the results.

{{<button href="/documents/neurostreams/katalog-en/Gaia_Club_Radio.pdf" target="_blank">}}
Gaia Club Radio :radio:
{{</button>}}

My new favorite.
It's deeper than DNA Talk and it's not meditation.
I just lie down and relax deeply.
Afterwards I'm more aware, refreshed and ready to tackle a new task.
My perfect Siesta track.

I put calming down as the first category for a reason.
Having the ability to calm down a frantic mind or recharge my batteries in
the middle of the day is just invaluable.

### Improve my work

Most of my personal and professional work requires a lot of focus.
Writing, studying, researching, reading, coding. Any kind of knowledge work.

There are some Neurostreams that put your mind into "focus mode".
Making it easier for you to focus and do your best work.

#### How I use them

The tracks are an easy thing to add.
I just have them running on my headphones while I work.
That's it.

I've had tremendous success with these.
Especially in combination with blocking out distractions (notifications,
interruptions and the like) and forging (doing without) consumption of
things that would be detrimental to my attention span (short-form video,
social media, the news, YouTube, etc.)

#### The tracks

{{<button href="/documents/neurostreams/katalog-en/IQ_7000.pdf" target="_blank">}}
IQ 7000 :brain:
{{</button>}}

My main concentration track.
It gets me deeply into focus mode.
Deep work made easy, just tune in.

{{<button href="/documents/neurostreams/katalog-en/Flow_meets_genius-Flow_triff_Genie.pdf" target="_blank">}}
Flow meets genius :handshake: Flow triff Genie
{{</button>}}

My all-round favorite Neurostream.
It also works well for getting me into flow and focus mode, but I can also
used more generally for lifting my my mood and decreasing anxiety or stress.

This track can be played via speakers.
Because of that I will switch between IQ 7000 and this one, so I don't have
to wear headphones all day.

{{<button href="/documents/neurostreams/katalog-en/Brainstorms.pdf" target="_blank">}}
Brainstorms :lightning:
{{</button>}}

As the name suggests: for more effective brainstorming sessions.
The beat is unpredictable and will trigger your brain to make new
connection.
Worked really well when I used it.

### Energize myself

Sometimes you are unmotivated and can't get going.
But, you want or need to perform.

These tracks are perfect for [generating energy](essay/power-plant).
They will speed up your brainwaves to a level of high activity
where **you will want to do
whatever you set out for yourself.**

For an acute case of demotivation.
Gets you up and going.

For whenever you need or want to perform.
Very helpful for getting yourself into shape for work, when you're not
really feeling it.

#### The tracks

{{<button href="/documents/neurostreams/katalog-en/Sturm_und_Drang.pdf" target="_blank">}}
Sturm und Drang :thunder_cloud_and_rain:
{{</button>}}

This track get me going.

### Falling asleep

Sometimes you just can't fall asleep.
For whatever reason.

Not being able to sleep is hurting your recovery and hurts your performance
the day after.

This is the most effective way I've found to addressing that problem.
All other solutions (writing down your thoughts, sleep drink, get up and
doing something else and then returning, etc.) are just hacks in comparison.

#### The tracks

{{<button href="/documents/neurostreams/katalog-en/Sleep_forcing-Schlaferzwingung.pdf" target="_blank">}}
Sleep forcing :sleeping: Schlaferzwingung
{{</button>}}

Personally I have a hard time falling asleep.
My wife can sleep anywhere and any time.
She falls asleep so quickly, it's astonishing.
But, that's not me.

When I'm excited about something.
When my thoughts are racing.
When I had a little too much bluelight or activity before going to bed.
I just sometimes have a hard time falling sleep.
I try it naturally, but at some point I need a hammer to knock myself out
and force it.

This Neurostream is that tool.
You just force yourself to fall asleep.

## Costs

I started with the [Panorama](https://www.neurostreams.de/portfolio/panorama/#aff=jneidel),
which is a diverse set of tracks covering the whole range of what
Neurostreams can do for you.
At only 9€ getting that was a no-brainer for me.
I recommend you start with it as well.

The Panorama itself will already get you quite far.
If you want some of the missing track or some variety (other versions)
of the Panorama tracks, then you can think about an upgrade.

**Don't think about upgrading until you have intensely tested the Panorama.**

Here are all the [upgrade options](https://www.neurostreams.de/produkte/#aff=jneidel).
I went for the Kompendium bundle, which provides all the classics that I
mentioned in this post.
For me it was ca. 110€, because I bought it through the Grand Slam (a bundle
with some other products.)
Otherwise it can be up-to 200€.
But, you can also buy tracks individually and get them accredited if you
decide you want a  bundle later on.
The laboratory (Labor) includes more niche, experimental tracks, which
weren't of interest to me.

**Try it for free**

- On the [homepage](https://www.neurostreams.de#aff=jneidel) Tim has a radio station that cycles through some tracks.
- [Signing up for the newsletter](https://www.neurostreams.de#aff=jneidel) gets you the title <a href="/documents/neurostreams/katalog-en/Planet_Relax.pdf" target="_blank">Planet Relax</a>.

## Conclusions

A great tool I don't ever want to live without.

It's in the 20% of optimizations that deliver 80% of the results for sure. (Probably even in the 4% or 1% that deliver 64% and 51% respectively.)

Neurostreams have something to offer for everybody and **I would recommend
everybody to try it**.
Start with [Panorama](https://www.neurostreams.de/portfolio/panorama/#aff=jneidel)
and use the [quick reference guide](misc/neurostreams-quick-reference) to
understand how to use the tracks.
Just do it.
