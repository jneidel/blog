All of the writing on this website is my own.
The writing was not and never will be partially or fully generated by an
AI/LLM tool.
All translations are also written by hand.

[Claude.ai] is used for research and occasionally, along with [DeepL Write],
while I edit.
Most thumbnail images were generated by [Microsoft Designer].
For code, AI is only used to debug.

The [process of writing](project/writing-365) about gives me a
deeper understanding of the topic and forces me to structure my thoughts.
It's organized thinking.
Why would I derive myself of that?
