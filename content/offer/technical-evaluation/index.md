## Your profile

You are a small team of non-technical people looking to hire or contract
development services.

## The problem you're facing

**You lack the technical expertise to evaluate**:
- a candidate for a CTO or Developer position.
- the proposal of an agency or freelancer.

The people, who are trying to sign a contract with you, have an interest in
taking advantage of you.
There are dishonest people, who want to get into a position or win a
contract they are not qualified for, whose quality guidelines they can not
meet.
They want to sell you a solution that is not a good fit for you or even
incapable of meeting your needs, just because it is the fastest or cheapest
for them to produce.

You can avoid costly mistakes and contract headaches by having a trusted
advisor on your side, who can critically evaluate the proposal or candidate
for you.

{{<lead>}}
I can be that trusted party for you.
{{</lead>}}

I will help find the best technical fit depending on your needs.
I will be on your side.
I am paid for my time and have nothing else to sell to you.
I have nothing to gain by working against your interests.

## How does it work

We will have an introductory call, in which you explain to me, what it is
you need me from me and what your requirements or expectations are.<br>
If we decided to go ahead together we will agree on a rate or fixed price
package.<br>
If I need anything else to understand your project or product I will request
it at this time.

Then you will send me the proposal, schedule the interview, or whatever it
was that we agreed upon.

Afterwards I will get back to you with the results in a timely manner.

## What I can do for you

Once I understand your needs and with them in mind I can:

- Evaluate the technical proposal for a project.
- Evaluate the codebase of a sample.
- Evaluate the GitHub profile of a candidate.
- Evaluate the results of a coding challenge.
- Edit a job description for you.
- Evaluate somebody for [conscientiousness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscientiousness).
- Screen a technical candidate.
- Lead a technical interview. Especially for Backend and Full-stack roles.

Afterwards I will make a recommendation as to whether or not the object
under evaluation is a good fit for your needs.
I will also explain my reasoning to the level that you require.

If you have something in mind for me, which is along the lines of what is
listed above, feel free to bring it up during the initial call.

## What I will not do for you

I will not build your project for you.
Not as a freelancer nor in any capacity.

I will not introduce you to candidates for an open position.

I will not schedule meetings and coordinate with any other involved party.

I will not respond on short notice (also depends on the type on request.)

I will not act as an impartial intermediary. I am on your team.

I am not your lackey.
Our relationship should be built on mutual respect.
