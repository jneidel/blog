I have decided to commit myself and take my writing to the next level.
The challenge is: 365 days of writing every day.

No off-days. No excuses.

## Intent

I want to get better at writing.
Doing something every day is a very effective way of getting better at
something.

I have a vision of this website in my mind that I want to bring to life.
That requires a lot of writing.
I want to spend this time working through my huge backlog of articles and
build traction for this site.

I thoroughly enjoyed writing my thesis in uni and have known since
that I want to make this practice a regular part of my life.

## Definition of Writing

I am a person that needs clear rules.
Uncertainty about what I can and can't do leads me to indecision and abusing loopholes.

- §1 Writing means writing something that will be used on this website.
- §2 **The minimum is one usable paragraph.**
It does not matter if the paragraph ends up being used.
The intention should be that it will be.
A note or rough draft does not count.
    + §2 a) Process-appropriate _translation_ work is a suitable alternative.
**The minimum for translation is a whole article**.
    + §2 b) Late-stage _editing_ is another alternative.
**The minimum for editing is bringing an article from the editing phase to publication.**
- §3 Writing needs to happen on some article that is in the pipeline, not
just: "Oh yeah, I wrote this note that will become an article later."

## Updates

Here I will keep a daily log of what I have written (updated weekly.)
