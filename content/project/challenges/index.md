{{<lead>}}
A way to continuously apply self-development learnings and expand my comfort zone.
{{</lead>}}

Any self-development learning can only be as good as your application of it.
If you don't apply it to your life, that idea means nothing.

Every week I am taking a self-development learning or something I want to
expore and formulate it into an actionable challenge:
A task for me to do every day,
an idea that I want to pay close attention to, as I go through my daily
life, or
a restriction on a certain behavior.

<!-- TODO: expand -->
I invite you to do something similar.

## My challenges

These are the learnings I have focused on.
In the middle of 2024 I converted the format into a
[newsletter](newsletter), where the challenges are clearly defined and I
give some more insight into my experiences and outcomes.

Current streak: 5 weeks completed
{{</badge>}}

- [x] Week 19: Applied:
  >[The power plant doesn't have power, it generates power](essay/power-plant)
- [x] Week 20-21: Applied [Eat that frog](essay/eat-that-frog)
- [x] Week 22: [Neurostreams](review/neurostreams) intensive
- [x] Week 23: Applied:
    > People are like balloons, with each interaction you can either
    let some air out of them, or blow them up a little.
- [x] Week 24: [No interrupting others](essay/no-interrupting).
- [x] Week 25: No new information. Don't consume anything I haven't read or
    listed to before.
- [x] Week 26: Listen to my purpose. Consider the things that I am doing.
Are they aligned with my compass (purpose) or are they not? What can I do
about the ones that are not? How can I strengthen the ones that are?
- [x] Week 27: Leave work unfinished. Leave a task you want to continue
later/tomorrow unfinished, so that you don't let it go and are drawn to it
later.
- [x] Week 28: Watch for signs of VAKOG. What are the conversation partners
preferred communication channels? Listen for signals. Preparation for an
upcoming [NLP seminar](/de/review/nlp23){{<de>}}.
- [x] Week 29: Dedicate some more attention to applying the Hemingway trick. See: [outcome](newsletter/1#last-challenge)
- [x] Week 30: Learn and apply the Milton model to my self-talk.
On the weekend make an effort to remember peoples names at the NLP seminar I'm attending. See: [definition](newsletter/1#next-challenge) & [outcome](newsletter/2#review-of-last-challenge)
- [x] Week 34: Improve presence in daily life.

- [x] Week 35: Wear formal clothing to promote abstract thinking.

- [x] Week 36-37: No audio-visual media.

- [ ] Week 39: 4x4 + Visualizations. Write down 4x4 goals (4 biggest
goals, 4 times each) followed by a visualization technique that sounds
actually effective. See: [definition](newsletter/6#next-challenge) <!-- & [outcome](newsletter/7#review-of-the-last-challenge) -->
<!-- - [ ] **Week <++>**: <++>. See: [definition](newsletter/7#next-challenge) & [outcome](newsletter/8#review-of-the-last-challenge) -->

<!-- - [ ] Week 36: Measure my awareness. Ask myself every 30m "How present are -->
<!-- you on a scale of 1-10?" -->
<!-- - [ ] Week 37: Pose a question to my unconscious in the evening, something -->
<!-- that I want solved for my brain to work on overnight. -->

If you have a suggestion for something I should try,
just [let me know](mailto:challenge-suggestion@jneidel.com) :slightly_smiling_face:

<!-- TODO: rework -->
<!-- ## What is this? -->
<!---->
<!-- My goal is to write an article about the experience of each challenge. -->
<!-- So for past challenges you will find those articles linked. -->
<!-- Each challenge also comes with a short description of what it's about/what my -->
<!-- intention for it was. -->

## Benefits of keeping a page like this

Defining challenges ahead of time stops this behavior in it's track:
"Oh, I don't know what challenge to do next", which leads to "Damn I forgot to
define a challenge" :right_arrow: "I guess I'll skip this week" :right_arrow:
_\*ignores next reminder\*_.

It also works as a way to keep me accountable to stick with these challenges.
I combine it with an accountability group that I keep up with every week.

This page will be updated continuously and it will grow with time.
