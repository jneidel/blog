This is a [now](https://nownownow.com/about) page. See also: [about me](about).
{{</lead>}}

Still living in the Brandenburg country-side and working as a Backend
Developer at Endava, together with my wife.
I reduced my work hours to three days a week.
Any spare time goes into [writing for this website](project/writing-365).
My purpose is to make the vision, that I have for this website, a reality.
General [self](essay/power-plant)-[improvment](misc/challenges) is another
topic.
Recently I've examined my limiting beliefs about money and have set up
accountability calls with people close to me.
