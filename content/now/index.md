Still happily living in the [Brandenburg][ee] country-side.

Three days a week I work as a Backend Developer at Endava, together with my
wife.
We work on a large Symfony (PHP) project.
Nowadays I mainly work on my own initiatives.
Recent ones were: integrating a documentation framework, designing a set of
webhooks to the client specs and now I'm overhauling the API documentation.

Personal projects that I have recently worked on, or am still working on:
- Tax optimization for the employee and self-employed personas
- Continously [writing](project/writing-365) new articles for this website
- Creating a [newsletter](newsletter)
- I did my NLP Practitioner and am post-processing and expanding on what I
learned
- Learning Spanish
- Testing out and finding a reliable investing/trading strategy for the
stock market
- Defining my long-term goals and aligning current and future project with
them
- Becoming more present as per [The Power of Now]
