When somebody tells me <q>I don't have time for that.</q>, my response, or
at least thought, is always: <q><strong>If you don't have time, you don't
have priorities.</strong></q>
To which they say: Nothing.
{.dropcap}

It's not that they don't have priorities.
They have priorities and are expressing them by saying <q>No</q> to
something.
If it was important to them, i.e. a priority, they would <q>make time</q>
for it.
If they had a toothache, they would find the time to go to the dentist.
If a loved on died, they would make it possible to go to the funeral.
If they were really hungry, they would

People <em>do have time</em>, but they would rather do something else.
And that's fine.
It's their time.
My problem is with the way in which they express it.
<q>I don't have time</q> in essence means <q>I don't want to</q> or <q>I'm
not interested.</q>
But they don't say that.
They go for in indirect or dishonest phrasing.
I see two possible reasons as to why:
1. They are unaware of the fact that are not <em>actually</em> interested.
2. They won't directly say they are not interested, for some reason (e.g. to
   be polite, not hurt the other persons feelings, etc.)
   <br>
   The response that 2. will get is:
    1. The other person is aware that "no time" = "no interest" and they
       recognize this phrasing as dishonest, defeating it's purpose.
    2. The other person is unaware, will mistake it as a sign of interest
       and, as a result, will spend more energy to try to make it work, find
       another date, etc.
       Politeness has the opposite effect, by making it worse for the other
       person.

Personally, I say <q>No</q> honestly, if I'm not interested.
Not in a harsh way, but by expressing how I actually feel about it.
For example:
- <q>No, but thank you for thinking for of me.</q>
- <q>Going to bed, at a reasonable time, is more important for me.</q>
- <q>I would be up for something, but I'm not interested in getting a
drink.</q>

I propose another date that works for me, if I already have something more
important scheduled: <q>I don't have time on Tuesday, how about Thursday
instead?</q>
Through this I express my interest and meet them halfway in finding a date
that works.

It's just better communication, as measured by it's outcomes.
