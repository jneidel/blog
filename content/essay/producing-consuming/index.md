Do you know what's the single best metric I've found to predict how I'm doing at
any given time in my life?
If I'm making progress toward my goals or not?
If I'm feeling good about myself or not?

It's the ratio between reducing and consuming.
Consuming a lot and producing nothing is then I am at my worst.
That's when I feel like a waste of space and don't want to talk to people.
The reverse is true as well.
If I am producing a ton and consuming little is when I feel like I can go out
and achieve my goals. I radiate positivity and go for what I want confidently.

It's a balance between producing and consuming.
Adding to one must take away from the other. Time is limited.

If I spend all my time playing video games, I won't do any programming.
If I keep surfing Reddit, I ignore my routine.
If I watch Netflix and lose track of time, I don't go for my walk.
If I read more, I will write less.

Consuming too little has never stopped me from getting what I want.

Producing too little has **always** stopped me from getting what I want.

This gets especially dangerous when the consuming _feels_ like progress. When
you are reading things that _could_ change your life, _if_ you were to apply
them (producing a change in your life.)

The world want you to consume. Products. Entertainment. Opinions. Knowledge.
But you have to resist.

The world only rewards production.

[^exception]: People how themselves only or mostly consume want to talk about
what they consume. The new Marvel movie, the new conflict that the news want you
to care about, "can you believe _INSERT CELEBRITY_ did _INSERT BAD THING_?", etc.
They identify with it because it's the only thing they have. They will reward
you for knowing what they know and look down on you for not getting the meme. But
that's only a self-defense mechanism because they feel inferior to you, the
person who actually gets things done.
