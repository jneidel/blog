> Yeah, like I was saying…

Imagine you're walking down a windy forest path.
You can only see some of the path in-front of you.
There are turns, diverging ways and dead trees to climb over.
You don't exactly know where you are going to go, but you'll figure it along
the way.

There is another person walking the path together with you.
From time to time they just push you.
Off the path and into the shrubs.
You're disoriented, but you get back on the path.
At a fork they push you in the direction they want to go in.
You're slowly climbing over a tree that fallen over the path and they push
you over it.
All good, you landed on your feet.
It wasn't pleasant though.

You decide to leave that person behind.
You come across another person to walk with.
This person let's you find your way.
They calmly wait while you climb an obstacle.

Who would you rather walk with?

## Get to the point already

The path you walking down is obviously an analogy for a conversation.
The pushy person is a conversation partner who interrupts you all the time.

With each interruption you have to find what you were trying to say again.
When you're missing a word (an obstacle) the other person finishes your
sentence with what they think you were trying to say.

As a consequence the person being interrupted has a harder time expressing
themselves and navigating the conversation in a satisfying way.

## A serial offender

That's me.
I think fast and often believed I _knew_ what the other person was trying to
say and was going to say.
I would try to hurry them along like "Yeah, I got that already" or "and
then you did x and y" etc.
Or I jump in to counter their point before they were done making it, based
on what I thought they meant.

The feedback I got to this behavior ranged from being thought of as rude or
aggressive to "You're not really listening to me."

I would auto-complete the words the other person was searching for:
- Other person: "I felt so…"
- Me: "weird, awkward, out-of-place"
- Other person: "eh, yeah, something like that…"

It denies the other person an opportunity to better understand how they feel
by finding the right words for it.
And that's a shame.

## Rehabilitation

<!-- TODO: this section is too big -->

Awareness.
As a first step you need to catch yourself interrupting.
Suppressing the impulse to interrupt is a second step.
Awareness comes first.
A lot is won by noticing that you're interrupting.

Observe how the other person reacts to it.
Some will be offended or start counter-interrupting you.
Some will not react at all or only very subtly.
That doesn't mean it has no effect, it just might not be observable to you.

Observe how it changes the conversation.
You might steer the conversation to topics that you want to talk about.
Does the other person get to bring up their topics?
Can they fully tell their side of the story?
Can the other person express how they really feel?
Are there things that you just had to say?

In the beginning your automatic interruptions will be too fast for you to
react to.
But with time, you will be able to stop yourself more and more.

There will be things, that you will want to say, for which there won't be an
opportunity.
The conversation moves on to a different topic or you forget it.
You will learn to let go of those things left unsaid.
Maybe the conversation was better off without them.

I like to clear my mind while the other person speak.
Holding a response in my head and waiting for an opportunity to throw it
into the conversation leads to more interruptions and worse conversation
flow.
The other person will give you the time to come up with what you want to say
as well.
So when they give you the room, you don't have to rush out a prepared
thought, you have the time to take all of what they said into account and
come up with a response.
It will also be a better response, because you were actively listening and have
taken in everything they had to say.

A method you can try would be to silently say to yourself, as you are
interrupting: "I'm not letting you finish your sentence because ______" (and
fill in the blank.)

This will reveal your reason for why you are interrupting.
Something you usually hide from yourself.
Here are some examples of what various people have discovered:

I'm not letting you finish your sentence because …
- … I already know where you're going, and I have something more clever to
say.
- … I might forget what I have to say and lose this great opportunity to
impress you.
- … you're having such a hard time expressing yourself, I'm going to help
you by saying it better.

All of these are bad reasons.

<!-- TODO: fix -->
A person who thinks like this see others as beneath them.
Like they need assistance.
A
thinks of the person they talking to as in
need of help and below them and they want to satisfy their ego.

That's not the kind of person I want to be.

## Examples from my own life

At my first job I would interrupt people who were explaining a problem with
what I believed to be the answer or a retort to why it's a non-issue.
A girl I did this to became very hostile with me and there were multiple
discussions with the leadership team about my behavior.
Showing respect to her (by not interrupting among other things) put us on
better terms.

In the same team I would also interrupt people how were taking forever to
get to the point.
That behavior would be appropriate if I were a scrum master or the moderator
of the meeting (I was not.)
Despite some people appreciating that I got the guy to stop rambling, it
still made me look uncooperative.
I'm seen as more of a team player since I stopped interrupting and it has
increased my standing in the team.

I talk a lot with my mom and I would always put the words in her mouth that
she was missing.
She would never hold that against me, but it still stood in the way of her
self-expression and made the conversation less valuable than it would have
otherwise been.
Our conversation have become much more helpful to her as a result of letting
her find her words and letting the conversation flow.

I interrupted my brother because I was looking down on him.
I didn't need the whole story because I knew all about what he was going
through.
I would launch straight into the wisdom I had to say about it.
Our relationship improved after meet him on equal term and I let him speak.

## Action

If you recognize yourself in any of these descriptions as an interrupter,
like I did, then this a topic you must address.
Otherwise it will stand in your way.
The people who like you will put up with it, but any high value person you
meet will pick up on your disrespectful behavior and avoid you in the future.
You won't even notice what it costs you.

### Questions

- Which of the interrupting examples is closest to what you do?
- Can you think of a recent conversation where you interrupted somebody?
- Are there people who you are interrupting more than others? Why them?
- What does your interrupting say about you and how you feel about others?
- Is there such a thing as a respectful interruption?

### Recommendations

For a week, commit to paying attention to how you are interrupting others.
Just notice your behavior when the other person speaks.
Remind yourself of this commitment daily (a note on your daily planner,
calendar, on your phone, etc.) and bring this awareness into most
conversations.
This is exactly what I did as part of a [weekly challenge](misc/challenges).

## References and Exceptions

Inspired by [I Need Your Love - Is That True? (Byron Katie)](https://www.amazon.de/Need-Your-Love-approval-appreciation/dp/1844130266?&linkCode=ll1&tag=jneidel06-21&linkId=016ef1711a48856b04fb1f162508e831).

Interrupting somebody, especially somebody rude or inconsiderate, can be a
power play that has it's place.
It still has a negative connotation, so you better have a reason for it.
You are trying to put the other person down, so it doesn't make you look
cooperative.
If the other people in the room don't agree with you, that the person being
interrupted was being disrespectful or was wasting everybody's time then
they could hold it against you.
