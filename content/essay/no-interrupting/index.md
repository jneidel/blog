> Yeah, like I was saying…

Imagine you're walking down a windy forest path.
You can only see some of the path in-front of you.
There are turns, diverging ways and dead trees to climb over.
You don't exactly know where you are going to go, but you'll figure it along
the way.

There is another person walking the path together with you.
From time to time they just push you.
Off the path and into the shrubs.
You're disoriented, but you get back on the path.
At a fork they push you in the direction they want to go in.
You're slowly climbing over a stone and they push you over.
All good, you landed on your feet.
You're still not sure how to feel though.

You decide to leave that person behind.
You come across another person to walk with.
This person let's you find your way.
They calmly wait besides you at the obstacle.

Who would you rather walk with?

## Get to the point already

The path you walking down is obviously an analogy for a conversation.
The pushy person is a conversation partner who interrupts you all the time.

With each interruption you have to find what you were trying to say again.
When you're missing a word (an obstacle) the other person finishes your
sentence with what they think you were trying to say.

As a consequence the person being interrupted has a harder time expressing
themselves and navigating the conversation in a satisfying way.

## A serial offender

That's me.
I think fast and often believed I _knew_ what the other person was trying to
say and was going to say.
I would try to hurry them along like "Yeah, I got that already" or "and
then you did x and y" etc.
Or I jump in to counter their point before they were done making it, based
on what I thought they meant.

The feedback I got to this behavior ranged from being thought of as rude or
aggressive to "You're not really listening to me."

I would auto-complete the words the other person was searching for:
- Other person: "I felt so…"
- Me: "weird, awkward, out-of-place"
- Other person: "eh, yeah, something like that…"

It denies the other person an opportunity to better understand how they feel
by finding the right words for it.
And that's a shame.

## Rehabilitation 

Awareness.
As a first step you need to catch yourself interrupting.
Suppressing the impulse to interrupt is a second step.
Awareness comes first.
A lot is won by noticing that you're doing it and how the other person
reacts to it.
In the beginning your automatic interruptions will be too fast for you to
react to.
But with time you will be able to stop yourself on more and more
interruptions.

A method you can try would be to silently say to yourself, as you are
interrupting: "I'm not letting you finish your sentence because ______" (and
fill in the blank.)

This will reveal your reason for why you are interrupting.
Something you usually hide from yourself.
Here are some examples of what various people have discovered:

I'm not letting you finish your sentence because …
- … I already know where you're going, and I have something more clever to
say.
- … I might forget what I have to say and lose this great opportunity to
impress you.
- … you're having such a hard time expressing yourself, I'm going to help
you by saying it better.

All of these are bad reasons.
You think of the other person as below you or you want to satisfying your
ego.

## Action

If you recognize yourself in any of the descriptions as an interrupter, then
this a topic you must address.
It will stand in your way otherwise.
The people that like you will put up with it, but any high value person you
meet will pick up on your disrespectful behavior and avoid you accordingly.
You won't even notice what it costs you.

### Questions

- Which of the interrupting examples is closest to what you do?
- Can you think of a recent conversation where you interrupted somebody?
- Are there people who you are interrupting more than others? Why them?
- What does your interrupting say about you and how you feel about others?
- Is there such a thing as a respectful interruption?

### Action Step Recommendation

Commit to paying attention to not interrupting people for a week.
Just notice your behavior when others are speaking.
Have a note on your daily planner, calendar, on your phone, etc. to remind
you daily.
This is exactly what I did as part of my [weekly challenge](misc/challenges) format.

See the book [I Need Your Love - Is That True? (Byron Katie)](https://www.amazon.de/Need-Your-Love-approval-appreciation/dp/1844130266?&linkCode=ll1&tag=jneidel06-21&linkId=016ef1711a48856b04fb1f162508e831).

Interrupting somebody, especially somebody rude or inconsiderate, can be a
power play and has it's place.
It still has a negative connotation, so you better have a reason for it.
You are trying to put the other person down, so it doesn't make you look
cooperative.
If the other people in the room don't agree with you that the person being
interrupted was being disrespectful or was wasting everybody's time then they
could hold it against you.
