## About me

### Who is Jonathan?

My _why_ is to help others by improving myself.

The more I can do, and the more effectively I can do it, the better I can help others.

I am currently working towards financial independence.
Achieving this would allow for a greater focus on my building and take on larger projects.
I could focus more of my attention on helping others.

### What I do

People are defined by what they do.
So here is how I spend my time.

#### Building projects

I create things to make my life and the lives of others easier.
This can take many forms.
As it is my area of expertise, I often leverage technology.

#### Learning

I am constantly expanding what I know how to do.
I seek knowledge that makes me change my behavior for the better.

#### Improving systems

I constantly improve the systems that make up my life and bring order to the chaos.

#### Writing

I write with the aim of learning more about myself, to synthesizing my knowledge
and unique perspective and making it accessible to others.

#### Enjoying life

I take the time to enjoy life, the natural environment around me and the
relationships I've built.

### What I don't do

The activities you don't engage in are just as important (if not more) than the
things you do engage in.

I don't:
- worry
- drink alcohol
- consume industrial sugar
- play video games
- watch TV/YouTube
- read the news
- use social media
- spend time with negative or discouraging people
